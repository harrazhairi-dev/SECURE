# Architecture Security Checker - MVP Requirements

## 1. Current Status ✅
- Enhanced CLI implementation complete
- OCR processing with improved accuracy
- Multi-provider LLM integration (Gemini/OpenAI)
- Comprehensive PCI-DSS analysis
- Structured JSON responses

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Command Line Implementation (COMPLETED)
```bash
# Current usage
$ python main.py path/to/diagram.png [--provider {gemini,openai}]
```

#### Working Features
1. OCR Processing:
   - Advanced component detection
   - Multi-color text extraction
   - Network boundary recognition
   - Debug output for verification

2. LLM Analysis:
   - Provider-agnostic architecture
   - Supports Gemini and OpenAI
   - Configurable through .env:
     ```bash
     # Debug Mode
     DEBUG=True
     
     # Default Provider
     DEFAULT_PROVIDER=gemini
     
     # Gemini Settings
     GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-key'
     
     # OpenAI Settings (optional)
     OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
     OPENAI_BASE_URL='your-url'
     OPENAI_MODEL='gpt-4'
     ```

#### Current Output Format
```
Security Check Results:
✓ Firewalls present
✓ Network segmentation
✓ CDE isolation

### 2.2 Next Phase: Slack Integration
- Bot implementation pending
- Will use existing analysis engine
- Need to add file handling
- Format responses for Slack display

## 3. Current Success Metrics
✅ Successfully processes different diagram styles
✅ < 30 second response time
✅ Provides actionable feedback
✅ Comprehensive PCI-DSS analysis
✅ Multi-provider support
⚠️ Needs more testing with various diagrams

## 4. Known Limitations
- OCR accuracy varies with diagram quality
- Limited to PCI-DSS focused checks
- No persistent storage yet
- No historical analysis comparison

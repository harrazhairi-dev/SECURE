# Architecture Security Checker - MVP Requirements

## 1. Current Status ✅
- Basic CLI implementation complete
- OCR processing working
- LLM integration functional (Gemini)
- Basic security analysis working

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Command Line Implementation (COMPLETED)
```bash
# Current usage
$ python main.py path/to/diagram.png
```

#### Working Features
1. OCR Processing:
   - Basic component detection
   - Text extraction
   - Network boundary recognition

2. LLM Analysis:
   - Provider-agnostic architecture
   - Supports both Gemini and OpenAI
   - Configurable through environment variables:
     ```bash
     # For Gemini
     export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-key'
     
     # For OpenAI (future)
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
     export OPENAI_BASE_URL='your-url'  # Optional for custom endpoints
     ```

#### Current Output Format
```
Quick Security Check Results:
✓ Firewalls present
✓ Network segmentation
✗ CDE isolation

### 2.2 Next Phase: Slack Integration
- Bot implementation pending
- Will use existing analysis engine
- Need to add file handling

## 3. Current Success Metrics
✅ Successfully processes different diagram styles
✅ < 30 second response time
✅ Provides actionable feedback
⚠️ Needs more testing with various diagrams

## 4. Known Limitations
- OCR accuracy varies with diagram quality
- Limited to basic PCI-DSS checks
- No persistent storage yet

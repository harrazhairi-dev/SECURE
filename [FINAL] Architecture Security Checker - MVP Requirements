# Architecture Security Checker - MVP Requirements

## 1. Core Focus
Build a simple PoC that can detect basic PCI-DSS network segmentation issues, focusing on:
1. Presence of firewalls
2. Basic network segmentation (public vs private networks)
3. Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) isolation

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 PoC Phase (Command Line)
```python
# Example usage
$ python check_diagram.py path/to/diagram.png
```

#### Input
- Simple PNG/JPG diagrams
- Focus on clear, well-drawn diagrams initially

#### Processing
1. OCR to extract:
   - Component labels
   - Network boundaries
   - Connection lines

2. LLM Analysis:
   - Single-shot analysis
   - Simple prompt focusing on:
     - Firewall identification
     - Network zone detection
     - Basic security control presence

#### Output
```
Quick Security Check Results:
✓ Firewalls present
⚠ CDE network segmentation unclear
✗ Missing DMZ for public-facing components

Recommendations:
1. Add clear network boundary for CDE
2. Implement DMZ for internet-facing services
```

### 2.2 Slack Integration
Simple bot implementation:
```
/check-arch [uploaded diagram]
```

Response in thread:
- Same output as command line
- Simple formatting for Slack
- Immediate response (no background processing)

## 3. Success Metrics
- Successfully processes basic diagrams
- < 30 second response time
- Accurate detection of obvious security issues
- Clear, actionable feedback

## 4. Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Complex diagram formats
- Detailed PCI-DSS requirements
- History tracking
- Educational links
- Custom rules
- Integration with drawing tools

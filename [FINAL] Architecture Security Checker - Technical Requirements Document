# Architecture Security Checker - Technical Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
To develop a Slack-based bot that helps business users self-check their architecture diagrams against basic PCI-DSS security requirements before engaging the security team.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Primary: Business users (developers, architects, project managers)
- Secondary: Security team (for feedback and oversight)

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Reduction in basic security review requests to the security team
- Early detection of common security issues
- Positive user adoption through Slack interface

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 MVP Features
1. **Slack Integration**
   - Slack bot command to submit diagrams
   - Simple feedback interface within Slack threads
   - Quick-action buttons for common operations

2. **Basic Diagram Processing**
   - Support for PNG and JPG formats initially
   - OCR to extract text and basic components
   - Focus on common PCI-DSS elements:
     - Network segmentation
     - Firewall placement
     - Basic data flow security

3. **Analysis & Reporting**
   - Quick-response format suitable for Slack
   - Clear "Pass/Warning/Fail" indicators
   - Links to relevant PCI-DSS requirements
   - Specific recommendations for improvements

### 2.2 Technical Architecture
1. **Slack Bot**
   - Simple command interface (/check-arch)
   - File upload handling
   - Thread-based responses

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   - OCR for text extraction
   - LLM for interpretation (GPT-4)
   - Basic rule engine for PCI-DSS checks

3. **Initial PCI-DSS Focus Areas**
   - Network segmentation validation
   - Cardholder data environment identification
   - Basic security control presence

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: PoC (Command Line)
- Basic OCR and LLM integration
- Simple PCI-DSS rule checking
- Text-based output

### Phase 2: Slack Integration
- Bot implementation
- File handling
- Basic response formatting

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- Feedback collection
- Rule refinement
- User experience improvements

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Processing time: < 30 seconds per diagram
- Support for 20-30 requests per week
- Slack file size limits
- Simple storage requirements

## 5. Future Considerations
- Additional compliance frameworks
- Integration with diagramming tools
- Advanced visualization features
- Custom rule creation
